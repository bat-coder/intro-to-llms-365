    "### OpenAI GPT Models\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates the use of OpenAI's GPT models through their Python API. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data. Key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completion API**: Used for text generation with models like `davinci-002`\n",
    "- **Chat Completion API**: Specialized for conversational AI using `gpt-3.5-turbo`\n",
    "- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (0-1), lower values for focused responses\n",
    "- **Max Tokens**: Limits response length\n",
    "\n",
    "### Langchain Framework\n",
    "Langchain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Loaders**: Tools for importing various data sources\n",
    "- **Text Splitters**: Break documents into manageable chunks\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Convert text to numerical vectors for semantic search\n",
    "- **Vector Stores**: Database for storing and retrieving embeddings\n",
    "- **Memory**: Maintain conversation context\n",
    "- **Chains**: Combine multiple components for complex workflows\n",
